"This folder contains actively maintained examples of use of ðŸ¤— "
"Transformers organized along NLP tasks. If you are looking for an example"
" that used to be in this folder, it may have moved to the corresponding "

"While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in "
"this folder are just examples. It is expected that they won't work out-"
"of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to "
"change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs. To help you with "
"that, most of the examples fully expose the preprocessing of the data. "
"This way, you can easily tweak them."

"This is similar if you want the scripts to report another metric than the"
" one they currently use: look at the compute_metrics function inside the "
"script. It takes the full arrays of predictions and labels and has to "
"return a dictionary of string keys and float values. Just change it to "
"add (or replace) your own metric to the ones already reported."

"Please discuss on the forum or in an issue a feature you would like to "

"since we want to keep the examples as simple as possible, it's unlikely "
"we will merge a pull request adding more functionality at the cost of "
"readability."
